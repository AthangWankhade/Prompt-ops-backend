The Republic's system, designed for a city-state, struggled to manage a vast territory.

      "speakerNotes": "The fall of Rome is one of history's most debated topics. It wasn't a single event but a 'long fall'. The Western Empire, with its capital in Rome, faced immense pressure. Its economy was crumbling, its political leadership was in chaos, and its borders were collapsing. The sack of Rome in 410 by the Visigoths was a major psychological blow, and by 476, the imperial structure in the West had completely disintegrated. It's crucial to note that the Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire, continued to thrive for another thousand years.",
